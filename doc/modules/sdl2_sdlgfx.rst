sdl2.sdlgfx - SDL2_gfx library wrapper
======================================
The :mod:`sdl2.sdlgfx` module is a :mod:`ctypes`-based wrapper
around the SDL2_gfx library. It wraps nearly all publicly accessible
structures and functions of the SDL2_gfx library to be accessible from
Python code. Note that unlike the other SDL2 modules supported by this
package, SDL2_gfx is not an official part of the SDL2 project.

Detailed documentation about the behaviour of the different SDL2_gfx
functions can found `here
<http://www.ferzkopp.net/Software/SDL2_gfx/Docs/html/index.html>`_ on
on the SDL2_gfx project website.
